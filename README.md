# Murmurhash

  The progrem will help you determine wether an object is in the table

  or not. I used the Murmur function in order to insert and withdraw

  the needed information

  **In order to use**
  
      1. You will need two text files:
          1. A text file with all the names of the objects you want to insert into the hash table.
          2. A text file with all the names of the objects you want to check if they are in the hash table.

      2. pip install murmurhash3
